# Peer Brain - A Decentralized P2P Social Network App

This open-source project implements a peer-to-peer social network app where users are represented as brain cells. It is completely decentralized and there is no central authority or recommendation algorithms, nor is there any censorship. Messages are propagated between users in a meritocratic way, and users have control over the strength of the signals they receive. This allows for more free and open communication between users.

## what are pull requests?

A pull request is a feature of many version control systems, including Git, that enables users to request changes to a repository from another user. This process is sometimes referred to as a pull request workflow. It usually involves a user submitting a request to another user (or a group of users) to make changes to a project or repository. The other user reviews the changes and then either accepts or rejects them. Pull requests allow for collaboration between users, as well as for users to track the progress of changes to a project.

## How does Git work?

Git is a distributed version control system. This means that each user has a local copy of the repository and can commit changes to it. When a user tries to commit a change, Git checks to see if the change is valid. If it is, the change is accepted and added to the repository. Then, when another user pulls the repository, they will get the changes. This makes it easy for multiple users to collaborate on a project. Additionally, Git keeps track of changes, so users can easily see the history of a project and can view previous versions.

## How does the open-source workflow work?

The open-source workflow is a process by which users can contribute to a project. It is typically done through a system like GitHub, where users can fork, or copy, a repository, make changes to it, and then submit a pull request. The project maintainers then review the changes and either accept or reject them. If accepted, the changes are merged into the main repository. This process allows for collaboration between users and for projects to be updated and improved quickly.
