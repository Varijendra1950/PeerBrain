# Peer Brain - A Decentralized P2P Social Network App


This open-source project implements a peer-to-peer social network app where users are represented as brain cells. It is completely decentralized and there is no central authority or recommendation algorithms, nor is there any censorship. Messages are propagated between users in a meritocratic way, and users have control over the strength of the signals they receive. This allows for more free and open communication between users.

If you want to contribute, you can fork this repository and issue pull requests! Feel free to use ChatGPT or OpenAI to help you with the coding.

### How does the open-source workflow work?
The open-source workflow is a process by which users can contribute to a project. It is typically done through a system like GitHub, where users can fork, or copy, a repository, make changes to it, and then submit a pull request. The project maintainers then review the changes and either accept or reject them. If accepted, the changes are merged into the main repository. This process allows for collaboration between users and for projects to be updated and improved quickly.
