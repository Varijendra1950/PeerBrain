# Peer Brain - A Decentralized P2P Social Network App


This project implements a peer-to-peer social network app where users are represented as brain cells. It is completely decentralized and there is no central authority or recommendation algorithms, nor is there any censorship. Messages are propagated between users in a meritocratic way, and users have control over the strength of the signal they send. This allows for more free and open communication between users.
